# pyRTX v0.0.2

A collection of functions, classes and tools for the computation of non-gravitational acceleration on space probes leveraging ray tracing techniques.

A collection of functions, classes and tools for the computation of 
non-gravitational acceleration on space probes leveraging ray tracing techniques.

This library is thought to help scientists and engineers working in orbit determination, 
navigation, GNC, and similar applications, by providing a framework for precise computation
of non-gravitational forces. 

Main features of pyRTX currently supported:
### Spacecraft modeling
Support for basic and complex, static and moveable spacecraft shapes. 
The spacecraft shape can be directly imported from the main 3D file formats. 
Flexible definition of the thermo-optical properties of every spacecraft surface.
([Example 1](Notebooks/lro_visualization.ipynb), [Example 2](Notebooks/full_visualization.ipynb))
### Solar radiation pressure 
Precise computation of the solar radiation pressure force and acceleration on the spacecraft.
Automatic computation of self-shadowing, secondary reflections and diffusive effects. 
Eclipse times computation using user-defined planet shapes and solar limb darkening.  ([Example 1](examples/lro_srp_complete.py))
### Planetary radiation pressure
Albedo and thermal infrared pressure computations based on user-defined planetary properties. 
Easy implementation of planetary characteristics maps (e.g.,n albedo and temperature). Possibility of
using planetary shapes based on digital terrain models for maximum accuracy. ([Example 1](examples/lro_planetary_radiation.py))
### Atmospheric drag
Precise computation of effective area. User defined density models. Plug-in structure allowing to use complex
density models (e.g., VenusGRAM, MCD, etc.). [(Example 1)](examples/lro_drag.py)
### Lookup tables generation and handling
Handful classes for computing, storing and reading lookup tables for improved computational performance. ([Example 1](examples/generate_lro_accel_lookup.py),[Example 2](examples/generate_crossection_lut.py))

# Installation
`pyRTX` requires the installation of a few C++ libraries, supporting the raytracing kernels.
This is automatically taken care of by the install script provided.
Given the amount of dependencies, the use of a virtual environment (e.g., conda or venv) is strongly required.

1) clone the repository
   `git clone git@github.com:gaelccc/pyRTX.git`
2) create an environment with `python>=3.8`
   `conda create --name pyrtx python=3.8`
3) run the installation
   `pip install .`

### NOTE: at the moment the installation has been tested only on Linux


<details>
<summary>In case the automatic installation doesn't work, here is a run through of all the steps required. </summary>

The installation process is quite convoluted, because of the dependencies on external libraries. 
For this reason we detail here two separate procedures: [automatic installation](#automatic-installation), [manual installation](#manual-installation)  

## Automatic Installation 
Clone the repository:  
`git clone git@github.com:gaelccc/pyRTX.git`  
After cloning this repository, just `bash simple_install.sh` inside the pyRTX folder.  

The install script will perform the steps detailed in the [manual installation](#manual-installation) section.    
Please note: 
- the installation script will need to download some files (notably the Embree libraries). The default download folder will be
`pyRTX/lib`. You can change this behavior in the header of the installation script.
- the installation process assumes that `conda` is available to the user.


Installation tested on Linux (3.10.0-1160.95.1.el7.x86_64) with gcc 9.2 compiler.

## Manual Installation
If for any reason the simple installation should fail, please follow carefully the following steps. 
### Download pyRTX and setup an empty environment
1) Download pyRTX folder
2) `conda create --name py38 python=3.8  --channel default --channel anaconda`
3) `conda activate py38`
### Install dependencies
5) `pip install "PATH_TO_MAIN_FOLDER" -r requirements.txt` (e.g., pip install -e ~/username/pyRTX -r requirements.txt)

### Minimal ray tracing dependencies
For the ray-tracing algorithms to work the ray tracing kernel programs need to be installed. 
Here we will detail the installation procedures for Embree 2, Embree 3 and CGAL. 
The user can decide to install only one of the three kernels.

### Installing Embree 2
Fetch and download the Embree version which suits your needs (e.g., https://github.com/embree/embree/releases/tag/v2.17.7)  
Unzip/untar the downloaded archive and place the resulting folder somewhere (e.g., in ~/usr/lib)  
Enter the Embree directory and   
`source embree-vars.sh` (or .csh depending on the shell in use)  

You can test the succesfull installation of Embree 2 by opening a python terminal and: 
`from pyembree import rtcore_scene` 

### Installing Embree3
This procedure is similar to the installation of Embree 2  
Fetch and download the Embree version which better suits your needs (e.g., https://github.com/embree/embree/releases/tag/v3.13.5)  
Unzip/untar the downloaded archive  
Enter the uncompressed folder and  
`source embree-vars.sh` (or .csh depending on the shell in use)  

#### Temporary fix to compilation issues with python-embree ([open issue](https://github.com/sampotter/python-embree/issues/23)) 
Clone python-embree (https://github.com/sampotter/python-embree)  
in the `python-embree` folder open `embree.pyx` with a text editor and comment `line 548` (i.e., `rtcSetDeviceErrorFunction(self._device, simple_error_function, NULL);`)  
And then:  
`pip install .`   


### Installing CGAL
Download CGAL from the official website (e.g., https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/releases/tag/v5.6)  
`tar xf CGAL-5.6.tar.xz`  
Download Boost from the official website (e.g., https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_82_0.html)  
`tar xf boost_1_82_0.tar.gz`  
Install the `aabb` binder  (thanks @steo85it !)  
`git clone https://github.com/steo85it/py-cgal-aabb.git`  
modify the setup.py file and add the path to the `include` dirs of CGAL and Boost  
from inside the `py-cgal-aabb` folder:  
`python setup.py build_ext --inplace`  
`pip install .`  

### Run tests
To verify the succesful outcome of the installation process, from the `tests` folder run 
`bash run_tests.sh`

</details>

# Quickstart and installation testing
Download the data required for running the examples running in the `examples` folder:

`python download_lro_kernels.py` 



# [Documentation](https://gaelccc.github.io/pyRTX)
The API documentation can be found [here](https://gaelccc.github.io/pyRTX)  
The user is strongly advised to look at the files contained in the `examples` folder and at the Notebooks contained in the `Notebooks` folder


# Change log
Version 0.0.2 implements the same functionalities as v0.0.1 but the code structure has been heavily restructured. Backwards compatibility is guaranteed for functions and classes call signs but not for imports syntax.
