Installation
============

For the moment we only support installation from source.
For the moment we support only Linux installation. 
We welcome pull requests to adapt the installation process to Windows. 


From Source
-----------
Make sure to use a fresh environment with only python (>=3.8) installed. 
pyRTX requires many dependencies from both C++ and python libraries. 
Using a fresh environment (e.g., using Conda) ensures a smooth installation process

First of all clone this repository
.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/gaelccc/pyRTX.git
Afterwards create a new evironment (here an example with conda)

.. code-block::bash
   conda create --name pyrtx-env python=3.8

Enter the pyRTX folder and install the C++ dependencies
.. code-block::bash
   cd pyRTX
   python install_deps.py

And finally install pyRTX
.. code-block::bash
   pip install -e .
