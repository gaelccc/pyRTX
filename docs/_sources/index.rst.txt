Introduction
------------
Welcome to the pyRTX documentation. 

This  library is thought to help scientists and engineers working in orbit determination, navigation, GNC, and
similar applications, by providing a framework for precise computation of non-gravitational forces.

Main fatures currently supported by pyRTX:

**Spacecraft modeling**
Support for basic and complex, static and moveable spacecraft shapes. The spacecraft shape can be directly imported 
from the main 3D file formats. Flexible definition of the thermo-optical properties of every spacecraft surface.

**Solar radiation pressure**
Precise computation of the solar radiation pressure force and acceleration on the spacecraft. Automatic computation 
of self-shadowing, secondary reflections and diffusive effects. Eclipse times computation using user-defined planet 
shapes and solar limb darkening. 

**Planetary radiation pressure**
Albedo and thermal infrared pressure computations based on user-defined planetary properties. Easy implementation of 
planetary characteristics maps (e.g., albedo and temperature or emissivity). Possibility of using planetary shapes 
based on digital terrain models for maximum accuracy.

**Atmospheric drag**
Precise computation of effective area. User defined density models. Plug-in structure allowing to use complex density 
models (e.g., VenusGRAM, MCD, etc.).

**Lookup tables generation and handling**
Handful classes for computing, storing and reading lookup tables for improved computational performance.
